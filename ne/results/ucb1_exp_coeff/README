# EXPLORATION COEFFICIENT (UCB1):

The following values have been tested: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1
All the configurations were tested averaging 10 experiments, with delta=0.4, 10 repetitions of 100 stimulations each (graph of 100 nodes).
The linearity of the features is not used.

For the best value (B=0.2) we tested also the "optimistic" initialization.
